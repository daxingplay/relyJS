relyJS is used to load resources, and provides a simple way to import other script files within script file!

This project is developed to solve the problem I encountered in my html5 game-project, which is i have to finished loading all the resource the game need.

This project can be used to load the script files, plain data files (html, css, json), images, etc.

simple example:
$r.load( { 
	url: ['a.js', 'http://neekey.net/bg.png', '../html/b.html' ], 
	callback: function( module, userData ){}
});

alse we can import other resource like we do in JAVA or C++, simple like this:

in a.js file :
	$r._rely(['b.js', '../c.js']);
	/*
		main code in a.js
	*/
